# SkillSwap

**SkillSwap** is a student-centric skill exchange platform designed to empower learners aged 10–30 who may not be able to afford traditional course fees. The platform fosters a collaborative, money-free learning environment where users can **teach what they know** and **learn what they need** — simply by swapping skills.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project aims to solve a real-world problem: **limited access to quality skill-based learning** due to financial constraints. With SkillSwap, users can both share and gain knowledge without the need for money — just a fair exchange of expertise.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Skill Verification via Micro-Tasks
- Before teaching, users must **prove their skills** through:
  - Coding tasks
  - Video explanations
  - Design uploads, etc.
- Auto/manual review mechanisms for skill validation

### 2️⃣ Skill-to-Skill Matching Engine
- Intelligent matchmaking between users based on:
  - Skills they can teach
  - Skills they want to learn
- Ensures **mutually beneficial exchanges**

### 3️⃣ User Profiles with Skill Badges
- Badges earned post-verification
- Profiles display:
  - Skills available to teach
  - Skills the user wants to learn
- Builds trust and transparency

### 4️⃣ Session Scheduling & Chat
- Users can send requests to schedule 1-on-1 sessions
- Integration of:
  - In-app calendar and time slots
  - Real-time chat
  - (Future Scope) Video call for live teaching

## 💡 Inspiration
